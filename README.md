# Monke Message!
This is a Rails app for messaging monkeys, colloquially referred to as Monke. Send them messages and those monkeys will message you back. The magic of how that happens is a closely guarded secret (a work in progress). In the interim, scaffolding and functionality to suppor this is being built.

Information on dependencies, configuration, database creation and initialization, test suite execution, and deployment instructions will come soon as the app starts coming together.
